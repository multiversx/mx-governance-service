Minting occurs only after legally binding agreements are publicly signed; all issued EGLD is locked for three years. Timing therefore depends on partner readiness and the second vote, not a fixed date."

The first year has a maximum theoretical maximum inflation of 8.757%, decaying toward a 2–5% steady range based on onchain KPIs (staking ratio, DeFi activity, protocol revenue via burns). A share of fees is burned, creating demand-driven deflationary pressure as usage grows."

If ~50% of staked EGLD participates in approved strategies, an additional 'pro-staking' component enables users to gain additional APR with an accumulated average rate of around ~16.47%. Actual outcomes depend on participation, KPI attainment, governance, and market conditions."

The builder share decreases by 5% annually for eight years (burn increases correspondingly) to reach a 50/50 split, with annual re-evaluation by governance. Base fees of non-contract transactions are fully burned. Priority fees are paid entirely to validators (10% leader, 90% consensus members). Failed transactions burn both base and priority fees."

These are measured onchain and evaluated quarterly using three-month rolling averages. Inflation decays more slowly in high growth and faster in low growth; within 2–5% it can adjust bidirectionally toward 2% (low growth) or 5% (high growth)."

For RSI tracks (DAT/ETF/US Labs), there are quarterly transparency reports, public tracking of locked funds/addresses (subject to legal constraints), and separate governance if material changes exceed the original mandate."

                        "answer": "No. The governance proposal introduces a double opt-in process for the RSI track to ensure both community approval and partner readiness before any EGLD is minted.\nHere's how it works:\n1. First Opt-In — Framework Approval: The current governance vote only approves the framework and mandate for RSI. No EGLD is created at this stage.\n2. Second Opt-In — Execution Authorization: Once the Foundation secures preliminary partner commitments and publishes a brief (including terms, structures, timelines, and legal documentation), a second governance proposal will be submitted. Only if that follow-up vote passes — and the legally binding agreements are signed — will the RSI minting occur.\n3. Safeguards:\n- All RSI-issued EGLD will be locked for 3 years.\n- Locked EGLD cannot vote in governance.\n- Minting transactions and custody structures will be transparent, with quarterly reports and public tracking (subject to compliance)."
