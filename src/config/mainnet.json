                    "question": "If the proposal passes, what is the implementation schedule?",
                    "answer": "The plan unfolds in three phases:\n- **Phase 1 (October 2025)** covers final proposal publication and the governance vote.\n- **Phase 2 (Q4 2025)** begins only if the vote passes: Oct 30 – publish the Staking V5 + Accelerator technical paper; mid-November (tentative) – launch Staking V5; Nov 15 – publish the Updated Fee Model paper and coded KPIs; DAO member elections and process definition in November; Supernova mainnet upgrade is tentatively set for December 2025.\n- **Phase 3 (Q1 2026)** targets Jan 15, 2026 for activating the new fee model and the KPI-coded emission logic, plus full DAO setup and public dashboards/roadmap."

                    "question": "How long will it take for the DAT and ETF to be established?",
                    "answer": "These are part of the **Reflexive Strategic Investment (RSI)** track and require a **two-step governance process**. First, the framework and mandate are approved; then, after partners/structures are soft-committed, a dedicated brief is published and a second governance vote authorizes minting locked EGLD and execution. Minting occurs only after **legally binding agreements** are publicly signed; all issued EGLD is locked for **three years**. Timing therefore depends on partner readiness and the second vote, not a fixed date."
                },
                {
                    "question": "What exactly changes in the monetary policy?",
                    "answer": "**MultiversX** moves from a capped-supply model to a **demand-modulated tail-inflation model** with a burn mechanism. The first year has a maximum theoretical inflation of **8.757%**, decaying toward a **2–5%** steady range based on onchain KPIs (staking ratio, DeFi activity, protocol revenue via burns). A share of fees is burned, creating demand-driven deflationary pressure as usage grows."
                },
                {
                    "question": "How are new emissions distributed?",
                    "answer": "Emissions are programmatically split into four buckets:\n- **50%** Simple Staking\n- **20%** Growth Dividend (users who engage in approved on-chain strategies)\n- **20%** Ecosystem Growth Fund (builders)\n- **10%** Protocol Sustainability (core R&D/infra)\n\nAllocations are subject to **annual governance review** and can be adjusted each year."

                {
                    "question": "What APR should stakers expect under the new model?",
                    "answer": "Illustrative modeling *(not a guarantee)* shows average **~9.15% staking APR** when 50% of supply is staked. If ~50% of staked EGLD participates in approved strategies, an additional **“pro-staking”** component enables users to gain additional APR with an accumulated average rate of around **~16.47%**. Actual outcomes depend on participation, KPI attainment, governance, and market conditions."

                {
                    "question": "How will the fee market change for builders and validators?",
                    "answer": "Base fees are split **90% to smart-contract authors** and **10% burned**. The builder share decreases by **5% annually** for eight years (burn increases correspondingly) to reach a **50/50 split**, with annual re-evaluation by governance. Base fees of non-contract transactions are fully burned. Priority fees are paid entirely to validators (**10% leader, 90% consensus members**). Failed transactions burn both base and priority fees."
                },
                {
                    "question": "How and when are KPIs evaluated to adjust inflation?",
                    "answer": "The model uses a **Composite Growth Score** derived from staking ratio, DeFi TVL/volumes, and protocol revenue (burns). These are measured **onchain** and evaluated **quarterly** using three-month rolling averages. Inflation decays more slowly in high growth and faster in low growth; within 2–5% it can adjust bidirectionally toward **2% (low growth)** or **5% (high growth)**."

                {
                    "question": "What governance oversight is planned after the implementation?",
                    "answer": "Annually, the distribution model and KPIs are **reviewed and voted on**; a **public, onchain, audited annual report** is produced. For RSI tracks (DAT/ETF/US Labs), there are **quarterly transparency reports**, public tracking of locked funds/addresses *(subject to legal constraints)*, and separate governance if material changes exceed the original mandate."

                {
                    "question": "If the proposal passes, will EGLD immediately be minted for the RSI (Reflexive Strategic Investments) initiatives such as the DAT and ETF?",
                    "answer": "No. The governance proposal introduces a **double opt-in process** for the RSI track to ensure both community approval and partner readiness before any EGLD is minted.\n\n### Here's how it works:\n\n1. **First Opt-In — Framework Approval**: The current governance vote only approves the framework and mandate for RSI. No EGLD is created at this stage.\n2. **Second Opt-In — Execution Authorization**: Once the Foundation secures preliminary partner commitments and publishes a brief (including terms, structures, timelines, and legal documentation), a **second governance proposal** will be submitted. Only if that follow-up vote passes — and the **legally binding agreements are signed** — will the RSI minting occur.\n3. **Safeguards**:\n   - All RSI-issued EGLD will be **locked for 3 years**.\n   - Locked EGLD **cannot vote in governance**.\n   - Minting transactions and custody structures will be **transparent**, with **quarterly reports** and **public tracking** (subject to compliance)."
